# Scripts Directory

This directory is for storing any scripts needed to set up or run your example.

Examples of scripts you might place here:

## Usage

Make scripts executable and document their usage:
```bash

## Template Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setup.sh - Setup script for EXAMPLE_NAME

echo "Setting up EXAMPLE_NAME..."

# Example: Download required data
# curl -o data/sample_data.json https://example.com/data.json

# Example: Install additional dependencies
# pip install some-extra-package

echo "Setup complete!"
```
