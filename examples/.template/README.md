## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install the NeMo Agent toolkit.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/EXAMPLE_CATEGORY/EXAMPLE_NAME
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>  # OPTIONAL
```

### Run the Workflow

Return to your original terminal, and run the following command from the root of the NeMo Agent toolkit repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
nat run --config_file examples/EXAMPLE_CATEGORY/EXAMPLE_NAME/configs/config.yml --input "YOUR_EXAMPLE_INPUT_PROMPT"
```

**Expected Workflow Output**
<!-- Replace with your expected output -->
```
YOUR_EXPECTED_OUTPUT_HERE
```

## Deployment-Oriented Setup

For a production deployment, use Docker:

### Build the Docker Image

Prior to building the Docker image ensure that you have followed the steps in the [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) section, and you are currently in the NeMo Agent toolkit virtual environment.

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit repository, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --build-arg NAT_VERSION=$(python -m setuptools_scm) -t EXAMPLE_NAME -f examples/EXAMPLE_CATEGORY/EXAMPLE_NAME/Dockerfile .
```

### Run the Docker Container
Deploy the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 6006:6006 -e NVIDIA_API_KEY -e OPENAI_API_KEY EXAMPLE_NAME
```

Note, a phoenix telemetry service will be exposed at port 6006.

### Test the API
Use the following curl command to test the deployed API:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/generate' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input_message": "YOUR_EXAMPLE_INPUT_PROMPT"}'
```

### Expected API Output
The API response should be similar to the following:

```bash
{
  "input": "YOUR_EXAMPLE_INPUT_PROMPT",
  "value": "YOUR_EXPECTED_OUTPUT_HERE"
}
```

## Customization Guide

<!-- Add any specific customization instructions for your example -->

### Adding New Functions
1. Define a new config class in `register.py` that inherits from `FunctionBaseConfig`
2. Create a function decorated with `@register_function`
3. Add the function to your `config.yml` file
4. Update the workflow's `tool_names` list

### Modifying the Agent
- Change the `_type` in the workflow section to use different agent types
- Adjust `max_iterations`, `temperature`, or other parameters as needed
- Add custom system prompts or modify the agent behavior

### Using Different Models
- Update the `model_name` in the LLM configuration
- Adjust parameters such as `temperature` and `max_tokens`
- Switch between different LLM providers (OpenAI, NIM, and so on)
